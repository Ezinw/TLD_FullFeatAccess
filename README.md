# TLD_FullFeatAccess

Untested mod. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

- Enable access to 5 feats in every game mode or use TLD default values. (Does not apply to challenge mode)
- Unlock all feats.

- Enabling the DarkWalker feat will also auto-complete the 'Escape The DarkWalker' challenge to prevent odd behavior.

- Adjust feat requirements and benifts that a feat provides (available for most feats).
